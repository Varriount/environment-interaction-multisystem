## Community Compendium

The mechanism of the module allows you to share actors and items with the macros and pre-set configurations, so it is very easy to exchange ideas between users.
For lack of time I don't know if and when I will be able to create a compendium of examples, I ask the community to try to help me by open a issue [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/p4535992/environment-interactionenvironment-interaction-multisystem/issues ).
